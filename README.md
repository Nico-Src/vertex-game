### Rules:
> Vertex is a unique kind of puzzle game based upon logic, in which players must connect points (also known as vertices or dots) together to form triangles that combine to form a larger image. As a game of trial and error, players can draw as many lines as they require to find the eventual solution, which can be viewed as a standalone graphic at the end of each puzzle.
